This is for my D&D campaign that I am running. I'm mainly writing this so that I don't have to worry about sloppy notes for npc's and encounters, and so I can easily manage rolls and characters when I don't have dice or sheets on me.

Once I have the character sheet functions working fully, I'll leave a descriptor on how to use them
